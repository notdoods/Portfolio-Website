    description: [
      `I started developing as an undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine in 2015 
      with a major in Computer Game Science. During my studies at UCI, I've studied various sectors of computer science, 
      including artificial intelligence, data management, and game development`,

      `Although I learned a lot during my undergraduate path, I wanted to seek more and deeper depth of knowledge of
      such topics that I have learned. I am now a master's student at California State University, Long Beach for computer 
      science. While getting more knowledge of back-end development, I simultaneously looked into more front-end, working 
      as a student web and applications developer for CSULB's Associated Student, Inc.`,

      `On the front-end, I've been coding in React, Node.js, Nextjs, PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. 
      As for back-end, I use Python, Jupyter Notebook, Java, C#, and C++. In addition to programming, 
      I have some experience in other technologies like Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL, Tableau, Firebase, and 
      Joomla.`,
