## Personal Portfolio Website by Kevin Chao

This is a portfolio website used to display my skills and projects as a developer. This particular one was inspired and uses a lot of similar designs as <a href="https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website" target="_blank"> Manu Arora's</a> portfolio, which also takes inspiration from <a href="https://kevinclark.ca" target="_blank">Kevin Clark's</a> website. I adjusted and created new sections to tailor it to my personal skills and needs.

This was built with NextJS and TailwindCSS, and if you want to see what it looks like head over to my portfolio website at <a href="https://www.kevinhchao.com/" target="_blank">www.kevinhchao.com</a>
